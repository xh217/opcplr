Description: Complex genomic rearrangements are common rare in normal tissues but a majority of the tumor genomes have extensive rearrangements, including complex events. Until other classes of genomic alterations, complex rearrangements in tumors are least characterized due to technological limitations, which has led to debates about their architectures and etiologies. Here, we assess the application of genome-graph concept utilizing deep coverage optical mapping genome sequencing.
